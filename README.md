The brand personality is:

## Design Decisions

### Colour Choices

The colour palette is inspired by traditional Indian sweets:

- Saffron tone for headings and accents  
- Cream background for softness and warmth  
- Deep earthy secondary colour for balance  

This avoids harsh white backgrounds and creates a premium boutique feel.

### Typography

- Elegant serif-style heading font for heritage feel  
- Clean sans-serif body font for readability  

This balances tradition with modern clarity.

---

### Layout Decisions

- Mobile-first responsive design  
- Clean grid structure  
- Equal-height menu cards for visual consistency  
- Horizontal menu layout on large screens  
- Testimonials displayed in grid format  

The UI prioritizes clarity, spacing, and visual balance.
